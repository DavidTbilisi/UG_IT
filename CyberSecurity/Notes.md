## Risk Assassment
AV (Asset Value) - Provided by organisation <br>
EF (Exposure Factor) - Provided by organisation <br>
SLE (Single Loss Expectancy) = $AV * EF$ <br>
ARO (Annual Rate Expectancy) - Provided by organisation  <br> 
ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy) 


Example SLE: 
AV = 100$
EF = 50%
$SLE = 100\$ * 50% = 100 * 0.5 = 50\$$
