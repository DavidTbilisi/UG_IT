### Economics - How society manages its scarce resources
- Scarcity - the limited nature of society’s resources
- How people decide what to buy, how much to work, save, and spend
- How firms decide how much to produce, how many workers to hire
- How society decides how to divide its resources between national defense, consumer goods, protecting the environment, and other needs


### Pareto efficiency
 Is an economic state where resources cannot be reallocated to make one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.
 - Does not imply equality or fairness
### [Market failure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketfailure.asp#:~:text=A%20market%20failure%20refers%20to,or%20receives%20too%20few%20benefits.)
Market failure, in economics, is a situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market.



**Revenue** - Total amount of money generated by the sale of goods or services 
**Profit** = Revenue - Expense
**Scarcity** - The limited nature of society's resources.

### Business Definition
- For-profit
	- Profit seeking activity
	- That provides goods and services
- Non-for-profit 
	- Museums
	- Public schools
	- Government services
	- Social services

### Factors of production
`Mnemonics: New Harry Collects Exotic Kites`
- Natural Resources (Land) - Earth's materials used in production.
- Capital Resources (Man-made assets) - Assets for production (tools, machines).
- Human Resources (Labor) - Workforce; people working.
- Entrepreneurs - putting other factors together
- Knowledge - Information, expertise used in production.


### Types of Economic system
- Free market system
	- Capitalism
	- Mixed Capitalism
- Planned system
	- Socialism
	- Communism

### 10 Principles of economics
1. People Face Tradeoffs
	1. All decisions involve tradeoffs
	2. Efficiency vs. equality 
		1. **Efficiency**:  when society gets the most from its scarce resources
		2. **Equality**:  when prosperity is distributed uniformly among society’s members
2. The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It 
	1. Giving up best alternative
3. Rational People Think at the Margin (Marginal = Changing)
	1. Рациональный человек мыслит в терминах предельных изменений
	2. MB (marginal benefit) > MC( marginal cost )
5. People Respond to Incentives (Человек реагирует на стимулы)
	1. Economics ($)
	2. Social
	3. Moral
6. Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off
7. Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organise Economic Activity
8. Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes
9. A country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods & services.  
10. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.
11. Society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment




12. **People Face Trade-offs**: Choosing one thing often means giving up something else.
13. **The Cost of Something is What You Give Up to Get It**: Opportunity cost—the true cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
14. **Rational People Think at the Margin**: Decision-making involves considering marginal benefits and costs.
15. **People Respond to Incentives**: Behaviour changes when costs or benefits change.
16. **Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off**: Trading allows people to specialise in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services.
17. **Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organise Economic Activity**: Households and firms interacting in markets act as if guided by an "invisible hand" to promote general economic well-being.
18. **Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes**: When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy the situation.
19. **A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services**: Productivity is the ultimate source of living standards.
20. **Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money**: Inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods.
21. **Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off Between Inflation and Unemployment**: Reducing inflation often causes a temporary rise in unemployment.


## Lecture 2 - Supply and demand
[Invisible hand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp)
**Price taker** - man who can't affect price
### Market
group of buyers and sellers

- Competitive market - both sellers and buyers are considered price takers. No one can directly change price. 
- Perfectly competitive
	- All goods exactly the same


### Demand
- [Low of demand](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/demand-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-demand) - Higher price = Lower demand quantity 
- Demand (Demand curve) - Summary the relationship between quantity demanded and price
- Quantity demanded (a specific point on the curve)  - Willing and able to purchase
### Demand schedule
relationship between price of a good and the quantity demanded

| Price | Quantity |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0.00  | 16       |
| 1.00  | 14       |
| 2.00  | 12       |
| 3.00  | 10       |
| 4.00  | 8        |
| 5.00  | 6        |
| 6.00  | 4        |

### Market demand vs Individual Demand

$$Market Demand = P1 + P2$$
Market demand is sum of individual demands

| Price | P1 Quantity | P2 Quantity | Market Demand |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0.00  | 16          | 8           | 24            |
| 1.00  | 14          | 7           | 21            |
| 2.00  | 12          | 6           | 18            |
| 3.00  | 10          | 5           | 15            |
| 4.00  | 8           | 4           | 12            |
| 5.00  | 6           | 3           | 9             |
| 6.00  | 4           | 2           | 6             |
`On Exam: Which moves demand and which moves supply (curve shifters)`
### Demand curve shifters
The demand curve shows how price affects quantity demanded, other things being equal.

1. More buyers - Shifts to $\rightarrow$
2. More Income - Shifts to $\leftarrow$
	- Normal good - increase income = increase demand
	- [Inferior good](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp) - increase income = decrease demand (we don't buy cheap products if we have sufficient money)
3. Price of Related Goods
	1. Substitutes - ==increase price== of one causes an ==increase demand== of other. Example: pizza and hamburgers, Laptops and desktop computers
	2. Complements - ==increase in the price== of one causes a ==fall in demand== for the other. Example: VideoCard + Power Supply
4. Tastes
5. Expectation

### From Chat
1. **Income**
    - **↑ Income (Normal Goods)**: `demand++`
    - **↓ Income (Inferior Goods)**: `demand++`
2. **Prices of Related Goods**
    - **Substitutes ↑ Price**: `demand++` (for the good in question)
    - **Complements ↓ Price**: `demand++` (for both goods)
3. **Tastes and Preferences**
    - **Preference ↑ for a Good**: `demand++`
    - **Preference ↓ for a Good**: `demand--`
4. **Expectations**
    - **Expect ↑ Future Prices**: `demand++`
    - **Expect ↑ Future Income**: `demand++`
5. **Population**
    - **Population ↑**: `demand++`
    - **Population ↓**: `demand--`
6. **Government Policies**
    - **Subsidies for a Good**: `demand++`
    - **Taxes on a Good**: `demand--`

### Supply
Amount that sellers are willing and able to sell. 
- Law of supply

### Supply Curve

- **Quantity Supplied**: The amount of a good or service that sellers are willing and able to sell at a given price.
- **Law of Supply**: The principle that, all else being equal, an increase in the price of a good or service leads to an increase in the quantity supplied, and vice versa.
- **Supply Schedule**: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. It lists prices alongside the corresponding quantities that sellers are willing to supply at those prices.
- **Supply Curve Shifters**:
    1. **Input Prices**: A rise in the cost of inputs (materials, labor, etc.) can decrease supply, shifting the curve left; a decrease can increase supply, shifting it right.
    2. **Technology**: Improvements in production technology can make production more efficient, increasing supply and shifting the curve right.
    3. **Expectations about Future Prices**: If sellers expect higher future prices, they might supply less now, shifting the supply curve left, and vice versa.
    4. **Number of Sellers**: An increase in the number of sellers in the market increases the total quantity supplied at every price, shifting the supply curve right.
    5. **Taxes and Subsidies**: Taxes on goods decrease supply, shifting the curve left, while subsidies increase supply, shifting it right.
    6. **Government Regulations**: Regulations can either increase production costs, decreasing supply (shift left), or decrease costs, increasing supply (shift right).
    7. **Natural Conditions**: Natural events (e.g., weather, disasters) can affect production capacity, influencing supply positively or negatively.

### Short version 
- **Quantity Supplied**: Sellers' amount offered at a price.
- **Law of Supply**: Price ↑ → Quantity Supplied ↑; Price ↓ → Quantity Supplied ↓.
- **Supply Schedule**: Table linking price to quantity supplied.
- **Supply Curve Shifters**:
    1. **Input Prices**: Costs ↑ → Supply ↓; Costs ↓ → Supply ↑.
    2. **Technology**: Efficiency ↑ → Supply ↑.
    3. **Expectations**: Future Price ↑ → Supply now ↓; Future Price ↓ → Supply now ↑.
    4. **Number of Sellers**: More sellers → Supply ↑.
    5. **Taxes and Subsidies**: Taxes ↑ → Supply ↓; Subsidies ↑ → Supply ↑.
    6. **Regulations**: Stricter → Supply ↓; Looser → Supply ↑.
    7. **Natural Conditions**: Favourable → Supply ↑; Unfavourable → Supply ↓.

### Equilibrium price - Supply and demand meet each other
| Price | Supply | Demand |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| $0.00 | 24     | 0      |
| ...   | ...    | ...    |

### Surplus (excess supply)
A surplus describes the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that's actively utilised. A surplus can refer to a host of different items, including income, profits, capital, and goods.

### Shortage (excess demand)
