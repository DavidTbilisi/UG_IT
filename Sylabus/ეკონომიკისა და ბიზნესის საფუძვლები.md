## 10 Principles of economics
1. People Face Tradeoffs
	1. All decisions involve tradeoffs
	2. Efficiency vs. equality 
		1. **Efficiency**:  when society gets the most from its scarce resources
		2. **Equality**:  when prosperity is distributed uniformly among society’s members
2. The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It 
	1. Giving up best alternative
3. Rational People Think at the Margin (Marginal = Changing)
	1. Рациональный человек мыслит в терминах предельных изменений
	2. MB (marginal benefit) > MC( marginal cost )
5. People Respond to Incentives (Человек реагирует на стимулы)
	1. Economics ($)
	2. Social
	3. Moral
6. Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off
7. Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organise Economic Activity
8. Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes
9. A country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods & services.  
10. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.
11. Society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment




12. **People Face Trade-offs**: Choosing one thing often means giving up something else.
13. **The Cost of Something is What You Give Up to Get It**: Opportunity cost—the true cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
14. **Rational People Think at the Margin**: Decision-making involves considering marginal benefits and costs.
15. **People Respond to Incentives**: Behaviour changes when costs or benefits change.
16. **Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off**: Trading allows people to specialise in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services.
17. **Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organise Economic Activity**: Households and firms interacting in markets act as if guided by an "invisible hand" to promote general economic well-being.
18. **Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes**: When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy the situation.
19. **A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services**: Productivity is the ultimate source of living standards.
20. **Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money**: Inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods.
21. **Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off Between Inflation and Unemployment**: Reducing inflation often causes a temporary rise in unemployment.
