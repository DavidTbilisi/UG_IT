### Economics - How society manages its scarce resources
- Scarcity - the limited nature of society’s resources
- How people decide what to buy, how much to work, save, and spend
- How firms decide how much to produce, how many workers to hire
- How society decides how to divide its resources between national defense, consumer goods, protecting the environment, and other needs


### Pareto efficiency
 Is an economic state where resources cannot be reallocated to make one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.
 - Does not imply equality or fairness
### [Market failure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketfailure.asp#:~:text=A%20market%20failure%20refers%20to,or%20receives%20too%20few%20benefits.)
Market failure, in economics, is a situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market.



**Revenue** - Total amount of money generated by the sale of goods or services 
**Profit** = Revenue - Expense
**Scarcity** - The limited nature of society's resources.

### Business Definition
- For-profit
	- Profit seeking activity
	- That provides goods and services
- Non-for-profit 
	- Museums
	- Public schools
	- Government services
	- Social services

### Factors of production
`Mnemonics: New Harry Collects Exotic Kites`
- Natural Resources (Land) - Earth's materials used in production.
- Capital Resources (Man-made assets) - Assets for production (tools, machines).
- Human Resources (Labor) - Workforce; people working.
- Entrepreneurs - putting other factors together
- Knowledge - Information, expertise used in production.


### Types of Economic system
- Free market system
	- Capitalism
	- Mixed Capitalism
- Planned system
	- Socialism
	- Communism

### 10 Principles of economics
1. People Face Tradeoffs
	1. All decisions involve tradeoffs
	2. Efficiency vs. equality 
		1. **Efficiency**:  when society gets the most from its scarce resources
		2. **Equality**:  when prosperity is distributed uniformly among society’s members
2. The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It 
	1. Giving up best alternative
3. Rational People Think at the Margin (Marginal = Changing)
	1. Рациональный человек мыслит в терминах предельных изменений
	2. MB (marginal benefit) > MC( marginal cost )
5. People Respond to Incentives (Человек реагирует на стимулы)
	1. Economics ($)
	2. Social
	3. Moral
6. Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off
7. Markets Are Usually A Good Way to Organise Economic Activity
8. Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes
9. A country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods & services.  
10. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.
11. Society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment




12. **People Face Trade-offs**: Choosing one thing often means giving up something else.
13. **The Cost of Something is What You Give Up to Get It**: Opportunity cost—the true cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
14. **Rational People Think at the Margin**: Decision-making involves considering marginal benefits and costs.
15. **People Respond to Incentives**: Behaviour changes when costs or benefits change.
16. **Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off**: Trading allows people to specialise in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services.
17. **Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organise Economic Activity**: Households and firms interacting in markets act as if guided by an "invisible hand" to promote general economic well-being.
18. **Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes**: When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy the situation.
19. **A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services**: Productivity is the ultimate source of living standards.
20. **Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money**: Inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods.
21. **Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off Between Inflation and Unemployment**: Reducing inflation often causes a temporary rise in unemployment.


## Lecture 2 - Supply and demand
[Invisible hand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp)
**Price taker** - man who can't affect price
### Market
group of buyers and sellers

- Competitive market - many buyers and sellers
	- Regulated / unregulated
- Perfectly competitive

### Demand
- quantity demanded  - willing and able to purchase
- [low of demand](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/supply-demand-equilibrium/demand-curve-tutorial/a/what-factors-change-demand)
### Demand schedule
relationship between price of a good and the quantity demanded

| Price | Quantity |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0.00  | 16       |
| 1.00  | 14       |
| 2.00  | 12       |
| 3.00  | 10       |
| 4.00  | 8        |
| 5.00  | 6        |
| 6.00  | 4        |

### Market demand vs Individual Demand

$$Market Demand = P1 + P2$$

| Price | P1 Quantity | P2 Quantity | Market Demand |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0.00  | 16          | 8           | 24            |
| 1.00  | 14          | 7           | 21            |
| 2.00  | 12          | 6           | 18            |
| 3.00  | 10          | 5           | 15            |
| 4.00  | 8           | 4           | 12            |
| 5.00  | 6           | 3           | 9             |
| 6.00  | 4           | 2           | 6             |
`On Exam: Which moves demand and which moves supply (curve shifters)`
### Demand curve shifters
- More buyers - moves to right
- More Income - moves to right
	- Normal good - increase income = increase demand
	- Inferior good - increase income = decrease demand (we don't buy cheap products if we have sufficient money)
- Price of Related Goods
	- Two goods are substitutes. Example: pizza and hamburgers, Laptops and desktop computers
	- Two goods are complements. Example: VideoCard + Power Supply
	- Tastes
	- Expectation
### Supply Curve
- Quantity supplied - sellers are willing and able to sell
- Low of supply - 
- Supply schedule - 
- Supply curve shifters - 
	- Technology 
	- 


### Equilibrium price - Supply and demand meet each other
| Price | Supply | Demand |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| $0.00 | 24     | 0      |
| ...   | ...    | ...    |

### Surplus (excess supply)
A surplus describes the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that's actively utilized. A surplus can refer to a host of different items, including income, profits, capital, and goods.

### Shortage (excess demand)
