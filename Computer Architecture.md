## Microprocessor vs CPU
A microprocessor typically refers to a single-chip CPU that contains all the necessary components for processing data and executing instructions.
### Processor Specifications
- **Clock speed (GHz)** - heartbeat of the processor. How many times the processor can do something in one second.
- **Number of cores** - Each core is like a worker. 
- **Instruction set architecture (ISA)** - Just like people speak different languages, processors understand different sets of instructions.
- **Manufacturing process** (nm) 

### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Cheat Sheet

- **Definition**: The set of instructions that a processor can execute, essentially the machine's programming language.
- **Types**:
    - **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**: Simple instructions, aims for efficiency and speed.
    - **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)**: Complex instructions, designed to reduce the number of instructions per program.
- **Components**:
    - **Instructions**: Arithmetic, logic, control, data movement.
    - **Registers**: Small, fast storage within the CPU.
    - **Data Types**: Defines the kinds of data the CPU can process.
    - **Memory Addressing**: Methods to access memory locations.
- **Impact**: Influences software efficiency and processor design complexity.
